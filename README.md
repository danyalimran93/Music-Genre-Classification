# Music Genre Classification

# Introduction

A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions (rock, pop, metal, etc). It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style. 

Music can be divided into different genres in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. [1]
